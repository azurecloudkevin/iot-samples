# Omniverse Kit App Template
 
[Omniverse Kit App Template](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template) - is the place to start learning about developing Omniverse Apps.
This project contains everything necessary to develop and package an Omniverse App.

* Recommended: [Tutorial](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-app-template) for
getting started with application development.

## Build
 
1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template) to your local machine.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of your cloned repo.
3. Run `build.bat` to bootstrap your dev environment and build an example app.
4. Run `_build\windows-x86_64\release\nova.iot_telemetry.bat` (or other apps) to open an example kit application.
 
You should have now launched your simple kit-based application!
 
## Custom Extensions
The main extension is registered as omni.hello.world. In this extension, we load the usd and other required dependencies.
 
The robot arm extension is registerd as msft.robotcontroller. This extension handles robot arm movement by listening to incoming data in the session layer.
 
The widget extension is registered as omni.example.ui_scene.widget_info. This extension is activated by clicking on the robot arm and also listens to the incoming iot data from the session layer.

## Robot Simulator
 
This repo contains a robot arm [simulator](./source/mqtt_sim/) that can be used when the physical magnemotion data stream is not available. This module loops over data in a [csv](./source/mqtt_sim/pos.csv) file and sends the data to the configured mqtt broker. The simulator is deployed as a docker container in the cloud or can be ran locally for testing.
 
## Running robot simulator with Docker
 
To run the container with Docker, you need to set the environment variables using the `-e` option. Here's an example `docker run` command:
 
```shell
docker run -d \
  -e SIM_CERT_PATH='your_mqtt_cert_path' \
  -e SIM_KEY_PATH='your_mqtt_key_path' \
  -e CSV_PATH='your_csv_data' \
  --name your_container_name your_image_name
  ```
 
## Cloud deployment
 
This container can be deployed to the Azure Cloud and is designed to play nicely with Azure App Services + [Azure IoT Operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-operations/get-started/overview-iot-operations)
 
![Azure IoT Operations + Omniverse Architecture](./content/docs/azure-iot-operations-ov-spike.png)
 
To deploy the connector to the cloud you can use a powershell script and bicep template located [here](./source/mqtt_sim/cloud/deploy.ps1).
 
> ⚠️ **Warning** This script is designed to be run from a powershell and has only been tested on windows. It may not work on other operating systems (or the devcontainer)
 
 
```bash
.\deploy.ps1 -resourceGroupName 'ov-connector' -location 'eastus2' -dockerImageName 'acrsimplant.azurecr.io/mag_mqtt_sim:1.0.4' -sim_cert_path 'your-cert-path' -sim_key_path 'your-key-path' -csv_path 'your-csv-path' -docker_registry_password  'YourAcrPassword'  -docker_registry_server_url 'acrsimplant.azurecr.io' -docker_registry_username 'acrsimplant'
```
 
This will run a bicep deployment which creates an azure app service which points to the docker image you specify - (hopefully, containing your ingest_app_mqtt app.)
